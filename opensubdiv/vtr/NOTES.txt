The changes here are speculative and may not be of any benefit.

The problem of over-refinement -- as originally observed -- may be
occuring for other reasons and never be triggered as assumed here.


This all applies to the FVAR_LINEAR_BOUNDARY case...

These changes are applied to prevent subdivided refined FVar values
for edges from being set infinitely sharp -- under the premise that
these refined inf-sharp boundary vertices trigger the creation of
more irregular patches than necessary.

But adaptive refinement appears not to be triggering successive
refinement around the refined inf-sharp FVar values -- why?

Is it that the refined boundary FVar values are NOT being tagged
as inf-sharp?


The original problem was discovered as follows:

    - degenerate triangle (000) with distinct FVar values (012)

    - at level 1:
        - refined vertices from edges are NOT inf-sharp for geometry:
            - they derive from a non-manifold edge only
        - refined FVar values from edges ARE inf-sharp for UVs:
            - this triggered the "sharp ended interior edge" issue

    * adaptive refinement will always generate more patches here:
        - non-manifold edge triggers refinement, not FVar boundary
