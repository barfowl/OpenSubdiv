Work-in-progress...

Started on this when bogus indices for UV coords were being specified in some
of the example Obj files and making their way through parsing and into the
TopologyRefiner construction.  Changes elsewhere catch those indices in the
Obj parsing, but nothing stops bogus FVar indices from being encountered from
other sources.

Adding the desired checks to TopologyRefinerFactory<>::validateTopology()
turned not as neat as I would have hoped...

    - adding component index checking is straight-forward:
        - just validate indices between existence and correspondence

    - adding face-varying index checking is awkward:
        - FVar channels are not considered at all in validateTopology():
            - they have not yet even been created
        - need to extend prepareFaceVaryingChannels() to accomodate args
        * arguably checking FVar channels is distinct from "topology":
            - separate option may make more sense:
                - but does it then need its own callback, etc.?
