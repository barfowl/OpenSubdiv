This regression test needs a lot more work before commiting it to
the main repository...


The general approach is as follows:

    - compute limit points for uniform refinement to level L

    - build a patch table adaptively refined to level L

    - compute patch points corresponding to limit points:
        - build PatchTable for uniform refinement
        - use PatchParams of uniform PatchTable for correspondence
        - remember to skip holes (uniform faces but no patches)


Several issues result in an unacceptable number of differences:

    - positions:
        - semi-sharp creases limit behavior differs from patches:
            - semi-sharp features are limited as sharp
            - patches at semi-sharp features constructed as smooth
            - only affects the limit points at the semi-sharp feature:
                - refined interior neighbors will be limited as smooth
                - should correspond to corner of regular smooth patch
            - possibilities:
                - could modify Sdc limit behavior -- but only locally
                - refine to resolve semi-sharp -- too high for some
                * detect semi-sharp features and ignore (report?)
                    * DONE

    - normals:
        - degenerate normal vectors at smooth corners:
            - limit tangents will produce correct normal
            - parametric partials will produce degenerate normal
            * detect and resolve with 2nd derivatives:
                - this needs to be done when N is computed
                - will require full 2nd deriv eval and Taylor approx

        - normal vectors at inf-sharp features:
            - these are essentially undefined
            - only one value computed for a limit point of a vertex
            - multiple values computed for each patch incident a vertex

        - normal accuracy at extra-ordinary vertices:
            - Catmark patches to not use
